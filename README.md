## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **CMake 3.20** or higher
- **C++23 compatible compiler** (GCC 11+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2022+)
- **Protocol Buffers** compiler and libraries
- **gRPC C++** libraries and plugins
- **OpenCV 4.8.1+** with DNN support
- **Google Test** (for running tests)

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](https://stolyarchuk.github.io/aa-video/).

### Building the Project

```bash
# Configure Debug build
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build all components
cmake --build build
```

For complete build instructions and advanced configuration options, see the [Build Guide](https://stolyarchuk.github.io/aa-video/).

## 💻 Usage

### Starting the Server

Run the detector server with a YOLOv7 model:

```bash
# Using YOLOv7 for object detection (.weights+.cfg format)
./build/server/detector_server \
    --model=./models/yolov7x.weights \
    --cfg=./models/yolov7.cfg \
    --verbose=true
```

### Running the Client

Connect to the server and process frames:

```bash
# Connect to server and process input image
./build/client/detector_client \
    --address=localhost:50051 \
    --input=input/000000039769.jpg \
    --verbose=true
```

For complete usage instructions and command-line options, see the [Usage Guide](https://stolyarchuk.github.io/aa-video/).

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests with 100% pass rate:

```bash
# Run all tests
cmake --build build --target test
